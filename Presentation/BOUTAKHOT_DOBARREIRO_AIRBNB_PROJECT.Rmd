## Introduction

Our team is composed of only 2 members : 

BOUTAKHOT Jonathan and DO-BARREIRO Jordan

We are both in our last year of engineering school in ECE Paris, and this is our Airbnb Data Analysis Project

In this project, we will be able to download the data from Airbnb, prepare it, 
and display some useful features and compare them between several cities 
from 3 differents countries : France, Spain, and Belgium

We can acquire a lot of data from many cities from their website <http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html>

## Data Preprocessing
We read the data from the urls.csv file, then split the features, 
```R
  #read from .csv file
  urls_path <- file.path("./Data/all_data_urls.csv")
  print(paste0("reading data from ", urls_path))
  urls_df <- read.csv(urls_path)

  #split different features
  urls_features <- str_split_fixed(urls_df$listings_data_url, "/", 8)
  
  urls_df$country <- urls_features[,4]
  urls_df$city <- urls_features[,6]
  urls_df$date <- urls_features[,7]
```

## Some modifications..

We apply the filters, and then it is loaded
```R
  #apply filters : 3 different countries (france without paris, spain, belgium) and the last 3 available scraping dates of data
  urls_df <- urls_df %>%
    filter(country %in% c("france","spain","belgium")) %>%
    filter(city !="paris")
  urls_df <- urls_df %>%
    group_by(city) %>%
    slice_max(order_by = date, n = 3)

  print("urls loaded")
  return(urls_df)
```
